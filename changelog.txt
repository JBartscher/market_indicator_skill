kazi - Mayorate mod changelog

v8.whatever
-Added two new portraits.
-Portraits are available for player use again.
-Added four unique interaction images (one for every market in Rahst). They kind of suck, but whatever. 
-Improved Ravana sprite.
-New mount setup for Ravana.
-Changed some sfx
-Added Planetary AI Core market condition. Dramatically reduces food/domestic goods consumption in return for a dramatic increase in Metals/Rare Metals/Fuel demand (basically much of the population are AI's, so no need for food, right?). If you're clever, you may be able to make money off of metals for once.
-Shuffled around Rasht market conditions.
-Added Shrike Hunter-Killer Drone wing.
-Added Afterburner ship system for Shrike wings. Grants temporary speed boost (it's a bit of a shameless copy from SRA's Neriad, I must admit).
-Added Bubble Shield system to Tiamat. Upon activation, shield rapidly expands to 360 and the ship becomes completely invunerable for a short period of time. Shield bypassing weapons still work fine.
-Added Graser beam buff. Grasers now do bonus damage (up to about 100%-ish increase in damage) based on how much flux you have. They go from being "meh" to really potent fast (esp. in light mounts). Should encourage more brinksmanship. ;)
-Integrated relationships for other mod factions. 
-Added a consulate to Mayorate worlds. You can now chat with them about other factions and stuff. (mostly just for your own amusement)
-New Mayorate flag and logo graphics.
-All Rasht markets now have a significant amount of flavor text.
-Improved writing for most descriptions.
-Laserheads now deal directed damage (they fire in a cone pattern now... reduces friendly fire/improves killing power).
-Balancing stuffs.
-Probably a lot of stuff I forgot to mention.


v0.8.1
-The Mayorate no longer requires editing files to install. Just activate the mod and play.
-Fixed an economy bug that was causing markets to be a bit more intense than they should have been.
-Doubled Windstalker projectile health.
-Increased Tiamat built-in weapon range by 100. 

v0.8
-Added compatibility for 0.65a, which was a HUGE amount of effort to get working. Requires the latest versions of ShaderLib (0.9 Beta) and LazyLib (2.0), so make sure you have those!
-Added the Tiamat Destroyer Escort. It's a bit slow for a frigate, but much more tanky. Use it to really put the hurt on other frigates or escort your larger ships.
-Added Iolanthe, a new planet/market controlled by the Luddic Church. You can beat up on them to make the Mayorate/Pirates like you more. Or vice versa.
-Reshuffled the rest of the planets a bit.
-Lore rewritten. Not a carbon-copy of the Hegemony anymore!
-Added the "Indoctrination" market condition and custom art. Mayorate planets really need it to stay functional while being friendly with the pirates (otherwise it's food shortage/trade disruption ALL THE TIME). 
-Removed anamorphic flare effect on nukes. I was never super happy with it.
-Added flag/crest. Although I'm not super in love with it, this is the flag until I redo it again.
-All ships now have the Stabilized Shields hullmod built-in.
-PPC flux cost, cooldown, and damage decreased.
-Phoenix II rocket launcher damage/tracking/speed buffed. Think of it as a harpoon with worse tracking but more shots.
-Graser PD range increased.
-Lilith's weapon arcs adjusted to give it better PD capabilities.
-Lilith's main gun range increased to 650.
-Graser damage increased 20%.
-Laserhead explosion range decreased, damage increased.
-Tornado AM ammo increased to 5/10 depending on mount size.

v0.7.1
Giving credit where it's due, the overwhelming majority of the changes this patch are by Dark.Revenant. I made the material maps and the majority of the "phase leap" system. Most, if not all, balance and code changes are by Dark.Revenant.

-Now compatible with LazyWizard's "Version checker" mod.
-Nukes revamped to not be a complete game ender. Although they still retain a small amount of instant AOE (200 frag damage), the majority of the damage is now based on arrival of a blast "shockwave." The AI now understands that AOE damage exists and will shield itself appropriately.
-Normal maps actually work now. My bad on the last update.
-Added material maps for all ships. 
-Added new "phase leap" ship system (mounted by the Cimeterre). I completely recreated the teleport code to make it so that this system teleports you in whichever direction you're facing, as opposed to direction you're traveling/where your mouse pointer is (how the vanilla teleports work). Anything you teleport through takes 500 energy damage. Very satisfying to use. 
-Rasht background image quality increased (it was a little grainy before because I was trying to skimp on mod size).
-All weapon sounds are now mono to better cooperate with the Starsector sound player. This should make everything quite a bit more immersive.
-Massive code overhaul and jar-ification.
-Weapon arcs cleaned up.
-Decreased OP of Phoenix IIs to 4.
-Laserhead ammo decreased to 20.
-Graser PD flux per second increased to 100.
-Light graser flux per second decreased to 126.
-Belial PPC OP increased to 13, spread decreased.
-Flux torpedo: moves faster, range lower, damage decreased.
-Graser: DPS decreased to 733, OP reduced to 20, flux reduced to 210, range boosted to 700.
-Light TPC (lilith main gun): increased flux/sec to 150.
-Lilith: repair cost increased to 70, CR recovery/day increased to 10%. Default variant loses 3 capacitors. 
-Cimeterre: supplies/day increased to 5, repair increased to 180 (from 80), default variant loses insulated engine assembly (HINT: SHOOT ITS ENGINES!!!!!!)
-Foraker: supplies/day increased to 5, repair increased to 150
-Safir/Safir B: supplies/day increased to 1.5/2, repair cost increased to 100/120, crew cost increased.
-Del Azarchel: supplies/day increased to 10, repair cost increased to 500, CR recovery decreased to 3%/day
-Jamaran: Increased the repair cost to 450 from 275.
-Ravana: supplies/day increased to 18, repair cost increased to 1200.
-Inanna wings now us 0.75/day
-Raad wing: supplies/day decreased to 1.5, deployment cost increased to 7%
-Angha wing: deployment cost increased to 6%, now targets frigates
-Other changes I probably forgot to mention. 

There is now a public Github repository at [url]https://github.com/kazi11/mayorate[/url]. Feel free to submit a pull request if you feel you have something clever to add. 

v0.7
-Added Foraker-class destroyer. The Foraker is a light carrier with enough ordanance to not be a complete bore to fly, but is very poor defensively. 
-Added Safir-class freighter and conversion (destroyer escort). The Safir is quite an average shipping solution, but it still beats using Buffaloes, right? The conversion makes an okay missile support platform. Just don't try to actually take it into heavy combat. 
-Added Raad-class heavy fighter wing. Mounting a pair of PPCs, this craft is a credible threat to destroyers, frigates and fighters. Replaces the Reaver Gunship.
-Added Angha light bomber wing. Unlike other bombers, the Angha will decimate destroyers and light cruisers but is weak versus capitals. Mounts the special Tracer Rocket Launcher (8x400 damage, ultra-fast, bad tracking).
-Added the PPC weapon (small energy). It's essentially an IR pulse laser without the suck.
-Added Graser PD. A short-ranged PD laser that fires constant, discrete shots. Very comparable to LR PD lasers, but with different pros and cons (more power, less range). All Mayorate energy flak mounts now use Graser PD.
-Added normal maps for ALL SHIP SPRITES AND WEAPONS! (much purple was had!)
-Added ShaderLib lighting information for all Mayorate weapons.
-Added custom planet graphics for Ilkhanna. Kudos go out to Russian/European/American taxpayers for the base image for this. 
-Added custom background graphics for the Rasht star system. Again, thanks to Russian/European/American taxpayers for funding the telescopes that generated the base starfield. 
-Added improved Onslaught sprite.
-Added improved Condor sprite.
-Added improved Apogee sprite.
-Added improved Venture sprite.
-Added improved Mule sprite. 
-Phoenix missiles now track, which is a pretty significant buff. 
-Light Graser fire rate increased, damage decreased. Feels much more responsive when under player control now, although it's a little less bursty.
-Kashef Sensor Suite now gives +5% range, +10% weapon tracking, +50% sensor range. 
-Lilith hit with all-around nerf bat. It's still quite potent, but lost a lot of flux capacity, hull points, and weapon range.
-Inanna wing size decreased to 4. 
-Removed Reaver Gunship. It didn't look very cool and didn't feel particularly useful.
-Removed Esfahan-class destroyer. It was really OP and the art was bad.
-Removed Impactor Missiles. No one uses them, including me. 
-Removed the "Battle1" music track. I got tired of it. 
-Changes to Mayorate base hullstyle (more picturesque venting).
-Changes to Mayorate engine styles. Engines appear much hotter, and contrails are more prominent. All Mayorate ships/fighters/missiles now use custom Mayorate engines. Added "small" engine style for better graphics and performance for missiles/fighters.
-Mayorate faction color is now yellow. No more confusing their fleets with the Diktat! (happened to me all the time...)
-Various performance improvements (although implementation of ShaderLib will pretty much erase those gains in performance).
-Miscellaneous balance changes and other fixes not worth mentioning.

NOTE: Mod now requires ShaderLib.

v0.6
-Improved Del Azarchel, Cimeterre, and Lilith sprites.
-Improved Graser weapon sprite.
-Added 2 new portraits (old portrait has been removed).
-Added the Jamaran-class cruiser. The Jamaran is a slow, heavily armored carrier that can hold its own against enemy cruisers and destroyers. The Jamaran excels in the fire support role and lets you repair/deploy fighters much closer to the center of battle (meaning you will have less fighters "wasted" as they taxi back and forth to your carrier). Replaces the Esfahan.
-Removed the Esfahan from most Mayorate fleets. It's going to disappear altogether once I add a light carrier.
-Added the Flux Torpedo, a heavy energy weapon that devastates enemies at range (if you can manage to hit them with it...). Kudos go to Mesotronik for the wonderful "shockwave" effect. Comes as part of the Jamaran's standard loadout.
-Added the Laserhead LRM, a medium AOE missile. Upon reaching its detonation radius, the laserhead fires a spread of 20 laser bolts in random directions. Generally does more damage to larger foes, and tears apart tightly packed groups of frigates/destroyers INCLUDING your own (be careful!). Comes as part of the Jamaran's standard loadout.
-Added the Kashef Sensor Suite hullmod. Grants 50 percent bonus to sensor range and 10 percent bonus to weapon range. It's extremely useful for figuring out where the enemy is sending the bulk of their forces, giving you a much longer time to give orders/respond to threats. Comes as part of the Jamaran's standard loadout and has no skill requirements.
-Added "The Expanse" ambient music track.
