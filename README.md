The Mayorate
===============================
Adds a new faction with a completely new set of sprites, music, sfx, and shaders. To install, simply extract and copy to your /mods subdirectory. Requires ShaderLib and LazyLib also to be present. It's generally safest to use the most up-to-date versions of those libraries if possible.

Submit any bug reports to the forum thread (or PM me) and I'll do my best to iron them out. Feel free to submit a pull request if you feel you have something clever to add.

Anyhow, enjoy!
