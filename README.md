The Mayorate
===============================
![](https://github.com/kazi11/mayorate/blob/master/graphics/ilk/illustrations/inir_surface.png?raw=true)

Adds a new faction with a completely new set of sprites, music, sfx, and shaders. To install, simply extract and copy to your /mods subdirectory. Requires ShaderLib and LazyLib also to be present. It's generally safest to use the most up-to-date versions of those libraries if possible.

This mod represents an entire faction with a number of cutting-edge technical features not present in the base game. This includes, but is not limited to fancy stuff like dynamic lighting, normal/materials mapping, combat music, true campaign-level scripting, and AOE weapons.

Submit any bug reports to the forum thread (or PM me) and I'll do my best to iron them out. Feel free to submit a pull request if you feel you have something clever to add.

Anyhow, enjoy!


(and yes, I did all of the art/coding and most of the music)
