HTTTm5-1,DialogOptionSelected,,,"“Although I am ashamed to admit it, Opel is a weak nation. Our military is outnumbered and obsolete. Aside from limited exports of food and domestic goods, the planetary economy cannot support itself. We need a strong leader.

I have a rather formidable fleet of Mayorate warships at my command. In addition to my military forces, the Mayorate has promised to modernize Opel’s industrial base and invest heavily into the local economy. In return, I answer to the authorities here and Opel becomes a Mayorate protectorate. I feel that this is a fair trade.","0:HTTT5-1-1-1:“Can you really make that decision for your people?""

Due to the way that the genetics work out, my family is rather prone to developing a severe and untreatable form of pancreatic cancer. This is the same condition that is about to kill my father.

One of the last produced before the Collapse, it is much more lethal than others you may have encountered in the sector. The rest of the fleet has been frittered away in skirmishes and battles on the system’s frontier- should be nothing more than a couple frigates and destroyers.”",0:HTTT6:“Let’s discuss something else.”,
