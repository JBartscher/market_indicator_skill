As you may already know, all contact with the Domain was inexplicably lost little more than two months ago. The rest of the locals seem as befuddled as we do- a gate outage of this duration is unprecedented. 

The situation has now deteriorated further. Not less than 5 standard hours ago, ground-based sensors detected a massive hyperspace surge near the Rasht system fringe. Preliminary analysis indicates the presence of a massive fleet, with capital class elements and a large number of military-grade transports. They are not responding to hails. 

Without further instruction from Sector authorities, our hands are forced. By the powers invested in her by the Domain, Colonial Mayor Amardad has authorized the engagement and destruction of this unknown force. We've recalled our fleet and pickets from outsystem, but they won't reach the planet in time. Your forces are the only thing that stands between the unknown fleet and the planet. Do whatever it takes to stop those transports, Commander.
