Treachery! Mayor Logalin lies dead on the steps of the capitol, and fighting has broken out across the planet. No doubt the Hegemony "negotiations" were simply a pretext to eliminate our entire high command in a single stroke. Our forces forces need time to regroup. I'm going to be honest with you, Commander, if the Hegemony is able to reinforce their positions on the planet, we are going to lose Ilkhanna.

Three hours ago, the Home Fleet engaged what we believed to be the main Hegemony invasion force. This appears to have been a feint. With our fleet out of position, a large convoy of troop transports and freighters has slipped through our lines and is headed straight for Ilkhanna. 

We've recalled the Home fleet and our pickets from outsystem, but they won't reach the planet in time. Your forces are the only thing that stands between the invasion fleet and the planet. Do whatever it takes to stop those transports, Commander.
