Location: Skies above Corvus II

Intelligence suggests that Hegemony forces have been spread thin in an effort to put a stop to the rampant piracy throughout the sector. This provides us with an opportunity. The defense fleet above Corvus II is the only obstacle to a full-scale strike on the Hegemony capital. Executed properly, a concerted assault by our forces should be able to overwhelm the Hegemony's strategic reserve and wipe out the planet's orbital infrastructure. The loss of their autofactories and industrial base will give the Hegemony no choice but to sue for peace.

In the event that the Hegemony leadership does not immediately capitulate, we are authorizing bombardment of the planetary surface. A list of possible targets has been uploaded to your tactical net, including the seat of government and various industrial complexes critical to the Hegemony war effort. Although we recognize that this is a clear violation of the Askonia Convention, this war has dragged on for far too long. Anything that will save lives in the long run is justified. Put an end to this, for all of us.
