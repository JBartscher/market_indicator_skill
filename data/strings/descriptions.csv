mayorate,FACTION,"Widely considered a political and economic pariah, the Mayorate is perhaps the only nation in which artificial intelligences and their human sympathizers coexist in relative harmony. Although resource poor and ultimately friendless, the Mayorate has survived through raw computational efficiency and a willingness to survive by whatever means necessary. Baseline humans play little to no role in government and economic activities - state affairs have been dicated by the Mayor, an AI of unknown capabilities, since the Collapse. 

A nation under constant threat, the Mayorate maintains a powerful navy and takes what it needs by force, treachery, and technological subversion. Frequent raids and diplomatic incidents have caused most governments to regard Mayorate forces as little better than common pirates. Nevertheless, some still speak of the Mayorate with a cautious sense of optimism - the Mayorate’s colonial archives remain untouched and intact. Together with it’s population of “benevolent” AIs, the Mayorate could be a powerful force for good - that is, if it ever chose to share its secrets.",,,

planet_Ashaak,CUSTOM,"Although endowed with significant mineral wealth, frequent pirate raids and unusual tectonic activity have ensured that Ashaak remains undeveloped. Aside from the initial Domain survey and orbital scans, relatively little is known about this barren world. ",,,
planet_ilkhanna,CUSTOM,"The Mayoral capital is made habitable by a number of Domain atmospheric processing plants that remarkably still function after hundreds of years of operation. Although the atmosphere is now breathable (abeit with some difficulty), Ilkhanna remains a backwater world, with a population of just over 2.3 million.",,"Originally registered on sector maps with little more than a catalog number, this world's obscurity offered a perfect location for the advancement of technologies otherwise forbidden by the Domain. Although the exact events regarding the foundation of Ilkhanna remain murky, it is clear that several experiments into artifcial intelligence proved wildly successful. A set of power-sharing agreements and a complex legal framework currently maintains a delicate balance between man and machine.",
planet_Inir,CUSTOM,"High levels of ionizing solar radiation have resulted in enrichment of several rare isotopes of hydrogen on the planetary surface. The Mayorate holds sway over Inir, operating a number of strategically important mining outposts near the southern pole. Surface temperatures on the daylight side can reach over 900K.",,"Although markedly unsuitable for human life, Inir is a world of immense potential. Easily accessible deposits of hydrogen and heavy metals are scattered across the planetary surface, drawing miners here since time immemoriam. Only the methods have changed. Since the advent of the Mayorate, most mining operations are now overseen by low-level AIs. Humans rarely, if ever, choose to leave the relatively comfortable confines of the larger settlements.  ",
planet_Iolanthe,CUSTOM,"A miracle of Domain engineering, the gaseous atmosphere of Iolanthe is seeded with dozens of atmospheric colonies. Until recently, these colonies lay mothballed and abandoned. A recent thaw in relations between the Mayorate and other factions has allowed the opening of a small independent gas mining outpost. It remains to be seen whether this detente will last, but for now, business on Iolanthe has been brisk.",,"The sky cities of Iolanthe are regarded as a bit of an interstellar oddity. Although tens of thousands of lives depend on their continued operation, the technology that keeps these installations aloft remains an enigma. Should one of these systems ever break down, nothing would stop the inevitable plummet into Iolanthe's crushing depths. The more devout of the local inhabitants point to this phenomenon as clear evidence of a higher power. ",
planet_Kerajj,CUSTOM,"A stunning sight to behold, Kerajj is said to burn with the light of a thousand suns. Its rays are as lethal as they are beautiful, however, rendering the system makedly unsuitable for multicellular life. Starships operating in the region are advised to mount increased EM shielding or experience decades' worth of wear in a matter of months.",,,
planet_Mun,CUSTOM,"One of the sector's premier achaelogical sites, Mun is littered with the wrecks of crashed spacecraft and primitive satellites- ostensibly ruins of a now extinct civilization. The race in question appears to have reached space through trial-and-error.",,,
planet_Ocinna,CUSTOM,,,,
planet_Opel,CUSTOM,"Once a verdant world, the 'Jewel of Kerajj' remains little more than a burned-out husk. With the collapse of the planetary economy and limited food supply, Opel has since settled into a feudal system, with a small landed nobility holding sway over the few remaining habitable settlements.",,"The collapse of the Veil, a planetary sunshade, is largely regarded as one of the worst catastrophes in the Sector's memory. Subjected to searing EM radiation, traditional agriculture disappeared within decades along with Opel's shallow oceans not long after. Few of its inhabitants remain on the planet by choice.",
planet_Sindral,CUSTOM,"A cold, dead world far from the system's core. Initial Domain surveys found little in the way of organic resource deposits or mineral wealth, and the planet remained undeveloped for centuries. The planetoid's only real value lies in its strategic location- fleets based here can effectively dominate Rasht's outer system. ",,"Remarkably, the Mayorate never considered Sindral an integral part of its borders. Until recently, an unsavory collection of mercenaries, men-of-profit, and “freedom fighters” maintained an uneasy peace over this world. Sensing an opportunity, these elements were more or less subverted by radical elements of the Luddic faith. The planetoid now serves an advance base in the Luddic crusade- craft captured in service of the faith are brought back to Sindral to be stripped for parts and repurposed for war. ",
planet_Voronoi,CUSTOM,,,,
ilk_station_kushehr,CUSTOM,"Built to a scale not seen since the fall of the Domain, the Kushehr Orbital Yards are massively overbuilt for a simple shipyard and trading post. The station's exact function remains a matter of some debate throughout the Sector. It's rumored that Hegemony Intelligence would pay a handsome sum for its schematics.",,,
,,,,,
ilk_star_rasht,PLANET,"Like other red dwarves, Rasht's emission spectrum lies primarily within the infrared range. Unfortunately, this means that the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll does not capture enough light for traditional agriculture. New crops must be extensively bioengineered before large-scale cultivation becomes possible, another art lost with the Domain. Understandably, traditional Ilkhannae cuisine is rather bland, with only twelve crops adapted to grow in these conditions to date.",,,
,,,,,
ilk_angha,SHIP,"Unlike most bombers, the Angha remains effective against smaller, destroyer-size vessels. Armed with the powerful Tracer rocket launcher, a wing of Angha's will decimate smaller craft caught without an escort. Just be careful to provide a distraction, or this bird of prey will not survive for long. Lack of any type of secondary ordanance makes the Angha extraordinarily dependent on close carrier support.",,,
ilk_cimeterre,SHIP,"The Cimeterre is literally a ship build around a gun, designed to close with and engage enemy cruisers and capitals with its Thermal Lance. An untested prototype until war broke out with the Hegemony, the Cimeterre found itself rushed through a massive production run in order to fill the tactical gap left by the retirement of the original Narayana cruiser. The Cimeterre functions best as a vulture- engaging and eliminating already weakened foes. 

Although armed with powerful weaponry and superior engines for its class, the Cimeterre lacks the flux capacity and defensive systems to remain in the field of battle for any extended period of time. Close fighter and frigate support is a must if this craft is to survive. Many captains cite this as a weakness in the Mayorate field of battle.",,,
ilk_del_azarchel,SHIP,"The Del Azarchel represents a complete redesign of the Mayorate's premier heavy cruiser, and improves on its predecessor in nearly every respect. Installation of a proprietary missile reloading system dramatically improves the Del Azarchel's firepower at range, and the Thermal Lance has been swapped out for a powerful gravitic driver. The Del Azarchel has established itself as one of the sector's most devastating missile platforms, able put over twenty missiles downrange in under a second.",,,
ilk_foraker,SHIP,"With a large number of weapon mounts and an expansive flight deck, the Foraker will make a difference on the battlefield. Briefly. Combat performance has suffered, as the lead shipwright opted to release the blueprints over three months before unique ship systems could be included.",,,
ilk_hk_drone,SHIP,"An unusual craft, the Shrike Hunter Killer drone is controlled remotely with the aid of a direct neural interface. Loss of a drone has been known to result in massive neural feedback, occasionally rendering its operator catatonic. Despite this small drawback, this control scheme allows high-g maneuvers that would normally pulp an ordinary human pilot. Boasting state-of-the-art technology, this drone's power (and price) is not to be underestimated.",,,
ilk_jamaran,SHIP,"Analysis of the Esfahan carrier's combat performance revealed a dangerous flaw in its design: it simply didn't look nice enough. Mayorate analysts believe that the Jamaran improves on its predecessor in this respect. Additional tonnage and cargo capacity allow it to act as a fleet support craft for deep space expeditions, and a limited flight deck gives it carrier capabilites. The Jamaran's main disadvantage is its speed- frigates and destroyers are often too fast to engage, and heavier craft will make quick work of an unescorted Jamaran. This cruiser makes a perfect flagship for captains who enjoy taking potshots at their enemy from range.",,,
ilk_lilith,SHIP,"One of the Mayorate's most advanced designs, the Lilith sacrifices survivability for raw firepower. Intelligence suggests that the Lilith's drive spines somehow serve to reduce the craft's inertia. This frigate mounts a miniaturized version of the Onslaught's Thermal Pulse Cannon, and excels in low-intensity engagements and commerce raiding.",,,
ilk_raad,SHIP,"The Raad heavy fighter excels in low-intensity engagements, applying constant pressure to light enemy vessels. Unfortunately, the Raad's low speed and large size present an easy target for heavy flak cannons. Deployment against dense enemy formations is discouraged. ",,,
ilk_ravana,SHIP,"The Ravana battlecruiser mounts powerful engines and energy weapons. Utterly terrifying in combat, the firepower delivered by its primary beam cannons will quickly reduce foes to heaps of molten slag. The mere presence of a Ravana on the battlefield is often enough to force an enemy retreat.",,,
ilk_safir,SHIP,"Rumors persist that trade will soon become much more important throughout the sector. The Mayorate will reconquer the stars, and possibly even restore the Domain. It's not unreasonable to believe that one day there even could be peace. Until such a time comes, however, the Safir's built-in coffeemaker will be little consolation to those captains caught without an escort.",,,
ilk_safir_converted,SHIP,"In times of desperation, the Safir's modular design allows it to be refitted as a combat vessel. The most popular conversion replaces the cargo pods with medium mounts and supercharges the engines for additional power. Much to dismay of the crew, the coffeemaker has been replaced by an additional flux capacitor bank. It's often enough to make a difference on the battlefield. Although the Safir B packs a sizeable weapons payload, it is important to remember that it is nothing more than a converted freighter. Taking this craft into the heart of battle will end... poorly.",,,
ilk_tiamat,SHIP,"Although the original Tiamat was a breakthrough in Mayorate ship design and fabrication techniques, critics lambasted its poor combat effectiveness and staying power. Indeed, the Lilith outshone the Tiamat in nearly every respect. Mayorate shipwrights sought to address these concerns, overhauling nearly every aspect of the original chassis. Of particular note is the addition of the experimental Bubble Shield generator- analysts expect this will allow the frigate to survive even capital-class firepower for short periods of time. Nevertheless, the Tiamat B remains unproven. Only time will tell if this craft is an asset to the Mayorate fleet.",,,
ilk_narayana,SHIP,"Slow, ponderous, and both heavily armed and armored, the Narayana-class superdreadnaught is perhaps the only Mayorate vessel able to favorably engage other capital-class craft. It is not designed for close combat, instead acting as an “anchor” for other Mayorate ships and dominating the battle with its impressive missile and fighter armaments. Perhaps it’s most intriguing feature, however, is the addition of an experimental ramscoop drive. The Narayana is actually able to collect and refine fuel from the exotic elements found in deep hyperspace and solar coronas. The ramscoop polarity can be reversed during combat – providing a powerful offensive weapon albeit at a grievous cost in fuel.

Though the Narayana is a key cornerstone of the modern Mayorate fleet, admirals have been remarkably stingy with it’s deployment to date– the destruction of one of these vessels represents a loss of nearly 5 percent of Rasht’s GDP. The majority of the Narayana class has never seen action, instead acting as a “fleet in being” to project Mayorate naval power without ever leaving port.",,,

ilk_bubble_shield,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The craft is enveloped in a tightly woven bubble of p-space, rendering it temporarily impervious to all known weapons technology.",Defensive,Renders the ship invulnerable for a short period of time.,
ilk_minelayer_he,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The AM12HE Minelayer deploys a spread of twelve high explosive mines equipped with a proximity fuse. Upon activation by an enemy target, mines will execute a short distance lunge and annihilate their target. Although easy to dodge and clear, a captain should be wary when facing craft equipped with the AM12HE system – a full spread of mines hits with the force of a Reaper torpedo. As a safety precaution, mines will self-destruct after 90 seconds if not triggered by enemy forces. ",Offensive/Defensive,Deploys a spread of high explosive proximity mines behind this ship.,
ilk_phase_leap,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A crude implementation of phase technology, this system executes a forward lunge through p-space. Although use of this device has been associated with a number of negative effects (including but not limited to disruption of the local space-time continuum), most pilots regard this as a feature: targets inside the jump path take massive damage.  If an enemy ship is targeted, the system orients the jumping ship with its nose facing the enemy.",Mobility/Offensive,"Teleports the ship forward a short distance, dealing damage to hostiles caught in the path.",
ilk_sprint_drive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Disables all engine safeguards and redlines the ship's primary thrusters for a burst of rapid acceleration. Consult a doctor before use. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and cardiac arrest.",Mobility,Greatly increases speed and acceleration for a short time.,

ilk_disruptor_heavy,WEAPON,"This weapon can lock down even capital-grade flux capacitors, rendering opponents helpless.",Close Support,,
ilk_driver,WEAPON,"A departure from traditional mass driver technology, creation of a localized gravitic field accelerates a trio of neodymium slugs to well over 0.1c.",Fire Support,,
ilk_fluxtorp,WEAPON,"Based upon a poorly-understood branch of quantum physics, this weapon fires an unstable envelope of pure flux. Devastating if it hits.",Fire Support,,

ilk_laserhead,WEAPON,"Instead of a traditional warhead, the Laserhead LRM mounts a series of beam emitters that are activated upon reaching detonation range.",Fire Support,,
ilk_nuke,WEAPON,A long-range missile tipped with a high-yield thermonuclear warhead. Deals massive AOE damage.,Fire Support,,
ilk_nuke_large,WEAPON,Fires long-range AOE missiles with a proximity fuse. Decimates unshielded warships and can neutralize multiple threats simultaneously.,Fire Support,,
ilk_phoenix,WEAPON,"Fires a pair of guided rockets that mount sizeable warheads. Although unreliable, it boasts excellent ammo capacity for its size.",Assault,,
