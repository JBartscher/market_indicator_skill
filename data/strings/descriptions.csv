mayorate,FACTION,"A reckless foray into the next steps of artificial intelligence and human evolution, a significant fraction of the Mayorate population now exists as artificial intelligences within vast planetary computation arrays. Although man and machine may coexist within its borders for the foreseeable future, most factions view these developments with a healthy amount of fear, even revulsion. An isolationist foreign policy and extensive military buildup has only served to ensure that the Mayorate remains a political and economic pariah. 

Until recently, the Mayorate has pursued a policy of near total detachment from events occurring within the sector at large. Few travelers return from Mayorate space, and fewer still have returned with news or meaningful intelligence. Rumors persist of a coup and vicious power struggles behind closed doors. It's unknown if these events are connected with the faction's abrubt change in foreign policy- it was only three cycles ago that the Mayorate opened its borders for the first time in centuries. The consequences of this event have only just begun to play out on the Sector's economy. ",,,

planet_Ilkhanna,CUSTOM,"The Mayoral capital is made habitable by a number of Domain atmospheric processing plants that still function after hundreds of years of operation. Although the atmosphere is now breathable (abeit with some difficulty), Ilkhanna remains a backwater world, with a population of just over 2.3 million.",,"Originally registered on sector maps with little more than a catalog number, this world's obscurity offered a perfect location for the advancement of technologies otherwise forbidden by the Domain. Although the exact events regarding the foundation of Ilkhanna remain murky, it is clear that several experiments into artifcial intelligence proved wildly successful. A set of power-sharing agreements and a complex legal framework currently maintains a delicate balance between man and machine.",
planet_Mun,CUSTOM,"One of the sector's premier achaelogical sites, Mun is littered with the wrecks of crashed spacecraft and primitive satellites- ostensibly ruins of a now extinct civilization. The race in question appears to have reached space through trial-and-error.",,,
planet_Sindral,CUSTOM,"A cold, dead world far from the system's core. Infrequent patrols and an utter lack of government oversight has allowed Sindral to become a haven for pirates and other ""undesirable elements."" The Hegemony accuses the Mayorate of actively encouraging these activities, a violation of the Hegemony Security Act, clause 21.02.3a.",,"Remarkably, the Mayorate has never considered Sindral part of its borders. An unsavory collection of mercenaries, men-of-profit, and “freedom fighters” maintain an uneasy peace over this world. Since the rise of the powerful Alvarez cartel, spates of violence have become relatively infrequent as of late. As long as you remember who's in charge.",
planet_Inir,CUSTOM,"High levels of ionizing solar radiation have resulted in enrichment of several rare isotopes of hydrogen on the planetary surface. The Mayorate holds sway over Inir, operating a number of strategically important mining outposts near the southern pole. Surface temperatures on the daylight side can reach over 900K.",,"Although markedly unsuitable for human life, Inir is a world of immense potential. Easily accessible deposits of hydrogen and heavy metals are scattered across the planetary surface, drawing miners here since time immemoriam. Only the methods have changed. Since the advent of the Mayorate, most mining operations are now overseen by low-level AIs. Humans rarely, if ever, choose to leave the relatively comfortable confines of the larger settlements.  ",
planet_Iolanthe,CUSTOM,"A miracle of Domain engineering, the gaseous atmosphere of Iolanthe is seeded with dozens of atmospheric colonies. Until recently, these colonies lay mothballed and abandoned. The recent thaw in relations between the Mayorate and other factions has allowed the opening of a small independent gas mining outpost. It remains to be seen whether this detente will last, but for now, business on Iolanthe has been brisk.",,"The sky cities of Iolanthe are regarded as a bit of an interstellar oddity. Although tens of thousands of lives depend on their continued operation, the technology that keeps these installations aloft remains an enigma. Should one of these systems ever break down, nothing would stop the inevitable plummet into Iolanthe's crushing depths. The more devout of the local inhabitants point to this phenomenon as clear evidence of a higher power. ",
planet_Kerajj,CUSTOM,"A stunning sight to behold, Kerajj is said to burn with the light of a thousand suns. Its rays are as lethal as they are beautiful, however, rendering the system makedly unsuitable for multicellular life. Starships operating in the region are advised to mount increased EM shielding or experience decades' worth of wear in a matter of months.",,,
planet_Opel,CUSTOM,"Once a verdant world, the 'Jewel of Kerajj' remains little more than a burned-out husk. With the collapse of the planetary economy and limited food supply, Opel has since settled into a feudal system, with a small landed nobility holding sway over the few remaining habitable settlements.",,"The collapse of the Veil, a planetary sunshade, is largely regarded as one of the worst catastrophes in the Sector's memory. Subjected to searing EM radiation, traditional agriculture disappeared within decades along with Opel's shallow oceans not long after. Few of its inhabitants remain on the planet by choice.",
planet_Ashaak,CUSTOM,"Although endowed with significant mineral wealth, frequent pirate raids and unusual tectonic activity have ensured that Ashaak remains undeveloped. Aside from the initial Domain survey and orbital scans, relatively little is known about this barren world. ",,,
planet_Voronoi,CUSTOM,,,,
planet_Ocinna,CUSTOM,,,,
ilk_station_kushehr,CUSTOM,"Built to a scale not seen since the fall of the Domain, the Kushehr Orbital Yards are massively overbuilt for a simple shipyard and trading post. The station's exact function remains a matter of some debate throughout the Sector. It's rumored that Hegemony Intelligence would pay a handsome sum for its schematics.",,,
,,,,,
star_red_dwarf,PLANET,"Like other red dwarves, Rasht's emission spectrum lies primarily within the infrared range. Unfortunately, this means that the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll does not capture enough light for traditional agriculture. New crops must be extensively bioengineered before large-scale cultivation becomes possible, another art lost with the Domain. Understandably, traditional Ilkhannae cuisine is rather bland, with only twelve crops adapted to grow in these conditions to date.",,,
,,,,,
ilk_lilith,SHIP,"One of the Mayorate's most advanced designs, the Lilith sacrifices survivability for raw firepower. Intelligence suggests that the Lilith's drive spines somehow serve to reduce the craft's inertia. This frigate mounts a miniaturized version of the Onslaught's Thermal Pulse Cannon, and excels in low-intensity engagements and commerce raiding.",,,
ilk_ravana,SHIP,"The Ravana battlecruiser mounts powerful engines and energy weapons. Utterly terrifying in combat, the firepower delivered by its primary beam cannons will quickly reduce foes to heaps of molten slag. The mere presence of a Ravana on the battlefield is often enough to force an enemy retreat.",,,
ilk_del_azarchel,SHIP,"The Del Azarchel represents a complete redesign of the Mayorate's premier heavy cruiser, and improves on its predecessor in nearly every respect. Installation of a proprietary missile reloading system dramatically improves the Del Azarchel's firepower at range, and the Thermal Lance has been swapped out for a powerful gravitic driver. The Del Azarchel has established itself as one of the sector's most devastating missile platforms, able put over twenty missiles downrange in under a second.",,,
ilk_cimeterre,SHIP,"The Cimeterre is literally a ship build around a gun, designed to close with and engage enemy cruisers and capitals with its Thermal Lance. An untested prototype until war broke out with the Hegemony, the Cimeterre found itself rushed through a massive production run in order to fill the tactical gap left by the retirement of the now-defunct Narayaan. The Cimeterre functions best as a vulture- engaging and eliminating already weakened foes. ",,,
ilk_jamaran,SHIP,"Analysis of the Esfahan carrier's combat performance revealed a dangerous flaw in its design: it simply didn't look cool enough. Mayorate analysts believe that the Jamaran improves on its predecessor in this respect. Additional tonnage and cargo capacity allow it to act as a fleet support craft for deep space expeditions, and a flight deck gives it carrier capabilites. The Jamaran's main disadvantage is its speed- frigates and destroyers are often too fast to engage, and heavier craft will make quick work of an unescorted Jamaran. This cruiser makes a perfect flagship for captains who enjoy taking potshots at their enemy from range.",,,
ilk_raad,SHIP,"The Raad heavy fighter excels in low-intensity engagements, decimating unescorted foes. Unfortunately, the Raad's low speed and large size present an easy target for heavy flak cannons. Deployment against dense enemy formations is discouraged.",,,
ilk_safir,SHIP,"Rumors persist that trade will soon become much more important throughout the sector. The Mayorate will reconquer the stars, and possibly even restore the Domain. It's not unreasonable to believe that one day there even could be peace. Until such a time comes, however, the Safir's built-in coffeemaker will be little consolation to those captains caught without an escort.",,,
ilk_safir_converted,SHIP,"In times of desperation, the Safir's modular design allows it to be refitted as a combat vessel. The most popular conversion replaces the cargo pods with medium mounts and supercharges the engines for additional power. Much to dismay of the crew, the coffeemaker has been replaced by an additional flux capacitor bank. It's often enough to make a difference on the battlefield. Although the Safir B packs a sizeable weapons payload, it is important to remember that it is nothing more than a converted freighter. Taking this craft into the heart of battle will end... poorly.",,,
ilk_foraker,SHIP,"With a large number of weapon mounts and an expansive flight deck, the Foraker will make a difference on the battlefield. Briefly. Combat performance has suffered, as the lead shipwright opted to release the blueprints over three months before unique ship systems could be included.",,,
ilk_angha,SHIP,"Unlike most bombers, the Angha remains effective against smaller, destroyer-size vessels. Armed with the powerful Tracer rocket launcher, a wing of Angha's will decimate smaller craft without an escort. Just be careful to provide a distraction, or this bird of prey will not survive for long. Lack of any type of secondary ordanance makes the Angha extraordinarily dependent on close carrier support.",,,
ilk_tiamat,SHIP,"Although the original Tiamat was a breakthrough in Mayorate ship design and fabrication techniques, critics lambasted its poor combat effectiveness and staying power. Indeed, the Lilith outshone the Tiamat in nearly every respect. Mayorate shipwrights sought to address these concerns, overhauling nearly every aspect of the original chassis. Of particular note is the addition of the experimental Bubble Shield generator- analysts expect this will allow the frigate to survive even capital-class firepower for short periods of time. Nevertheless, the Tiamat B remains unproven. Only time will tell if this craft is an asset to the Mayorate fleet.",,,
ilk_hk_drone,SHIP,"An unusual craft, the Shrike Hunter Killer drone is controlled remotely with the aid of a direct neural interface. Loss of a drone has been known to result in massive neural feedback, occasionally rendering its operator catatonic. Despite this small drawback, this control scheme allows high-g maneuvers that would normally pulp an ordinary human pilot. Boasting state-of-the-art technology, this drone's power (and price) is not to be underestimated.",,,
,,,,,
ilk_sprint_drive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Disables all engine safeguards and redlines the ship's primary thrusters for a burst of rapid acceleration. Consult a doctor before use. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and cardiac arrest.",Mobility,Greatly increases speed and acceleration for a short time.,
ilk_phase_leap,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A crude implementation of phase technology, this system executes a forward lunge through p-space. Although use of this device has been associated with a number of negative effects (including but not limited to disruption of the local space-time continuum), most pilots regard this as a feature: targets inside the jump path take massive damage.  If an enemy ship is targeted, the system orients the jumping ship with its nose facing the enemy.",Mobility/Offensive,"Teleports the ship forward a short distance, dealing damage to hostiles caught in the path.",
ilk_bubble_shield,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The craft is enveloped in a tightly woven bubble of p-space, rendering it temporarily impervious to all known weapons technology.",Defensive,Renders the ship invulnerable for a short period of time.,
ilk_minelayer_he,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The AM12HE Minelayer deploys a spread of twelve high explosive mines equipped with a proximity fuse. Upon activation by an enemy target, mines will execute a short distance lunge and annihilate their target. Although easy to dodge and clear, a captain should be wary when facing craft equipped with the AM12HE system – a full spread of mines hits with the force of a Reaper torpedo. As a safety precaution, mines will self-destruct after 90 seconds if not triggered by enemy forces. ",Offensive/Defensive,Deploys a spread of high explosive proximity mines behind this ship.,
,,,,,
ilk_phoenix,WEAPON,"Fires a pair of guided rockets that mount sizeable warheads. Although unreliable, it boasts excellent ammo capacity for its size.",Assault,,
ilk_impactor,WEAPON,"This torpedo is fast, deadly, and diffult to destroy. Perfect for slowly punching through the shields of capital-class warships at range.",Fire Support,,
ilk_thermal_lance,WEAPON,A brutal beam weapon that deals increasingly high damage at high flux.,Assault,,
ilk_repeater,WEAPON,"Loosely based on the venerable Thermal Pulse Cannon, this weapon can produce a powerful burst of firepower for a short time.",Assault,,
ilk_nuke,WEAPON,A long-range missile tipped with a high-yield antimatter warhead. Deals massive AOE damage.,Fire Support,,
ilk_nuke_large,WEAPON,Fires long-range AOE missiles with a proximity fuse. Decimates unshielded warships and can neutralize multiple threats simultaneously.,Fire Support,,
ilk_heavy_beam,WEAPON,A powerful beam weapon that cuts through heavy armor with ease.,Assault,,
ilk_graser,WEAPON,The blueprints for this powerful gamma-ray laser are a closely guarded secret. Deals extra damage at high flux.,Assault,,
ilk_graser_light,WEAPON,A miniaturization of the gamma-ray laser. Deals extra damage at high flux levels.,Close Support,,
ilk_driver,WEAPON,"A departure from traditional mass driver technology, creation of a localized gravitic field accelerates a trio of neodymium slugs to well over 0.1c.",Fire Support,,
ilk_windstalker,WEAPON,"Although relatively easy to shoot down, the Windstalker's magazine size is a major advantage in longer engagements.",Close Support,,
ilk_shotgun,WEAPON,The Belial PPC launches a formidable spread of superheated plasma flechettes towards the target. Weak vs. armor.,Assault,,
ilk_fluxtorp,WEAPON,"Based upon a poorly-understood branch of quantum physics, this weapon fires an unstable envelope of pure flux. Devastating if it hits.",Fire Support,,
ilk_laserhead,WEAPON,"Instead of a traditional warhead, the Laserhead LRM mounts a series of beam emitters that are activated upon reaching detonation range.",Fire Support,,
ilk_ppc,WEAPON,This plasma projection cannon literally slags foes at short range. Careful flux management is required.,Assault,,
ilk_graser_pd,WEAPON,"Although rather powerful for a PD mount, its range leaves much to be desired. Deals extra damage at high flux.",Point Defense,,
ilk_pulse_gun,WEAPON,"A powerful, if yet somewhat unwieldly short range weapon that takes down shields quickly with bursts of fire.",Close Support,,
ilk_disruptor,WEAPON,"Dealing almost no damage to a ship's physical defenses, this unconventional weapon cripples an adversary's flux management systems.",Close Support,,
ilk_disruptor_heavy,WEAPON,"This weapon can lock down even capital-grade flux capacitors, rendering opponents helpless.",Close Support,,
